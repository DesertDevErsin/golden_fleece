# Golden Fleece

Easy schemas for your JSON columns.

Golden Fleece lets you define a schema for your Ruby data models, which can be used to do fun things:

- Validate JSON data types and formats
- Normalize JSON data
- Provide default values within nested JSON

It's like [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) but more opinionated and, in our opinion, more straightforward to use.
